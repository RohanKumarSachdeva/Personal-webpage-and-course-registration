<p title="Overview">In a literal sense, the term modern physics, means up-to-date physics. 
In this sense, a significant portion of so-called classical physics is modern. However, since
 roughly 1890, new discoveries have caused significant paradigm shifts: the advent of quantum
 mechanics (QM), and of Einsteinian relativity (ER). Physics that incorporates elements of 
 either QM or ER (or both) is said to be modern physics. It is in this latter sense that the 
 term is generally used.Modern physics is often encountered when dealing with extreme conditions.
 Quantum mechanical effects tend to appear when dealing with "lows" (low temperatures, small
 distances), while relativistic effects tend to appear when dealing with "highs" (high velocities,
 large distances), the "middles" being classical behaviour. For example, when analysing the
 behaviour of a gas at room temperature, most phenomena will involve the (classical) Maxwell–Boltzmann
 distribution. However near absolute zero, the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution fails to account 
 for the observed behaviour of the gas, and the (modern) Fermi–Dirac or Bose–Einstein distributions
 have to be used instead.</font></p>
